The code is a C++ program that clears addresses in memory by finding strings with specific content. 
This example is used to clear strings from java.exe that were left over from nemezida.cc, a cheat client for the rustme project

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
If you are going to use this program for the same purpose as I do:
you must disable the cheat (self-destruction feature) before clearing the strings, 
as nemezida constantly updates the strings, making it impossible to clear them.
